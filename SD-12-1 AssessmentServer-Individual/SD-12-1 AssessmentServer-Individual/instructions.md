# Instructions (Server)

This project contains the JSON Server, and provides a Web API for accessing it.

When the server is run, the JSON database at `./db.json` will be cleared, and initialised with 5 default entries.

 * To reset the database, first Stop the server, then press Run to re-initialise the database.


## Tasks

1. Press the Run button to start the REST API Server.

2. Copy the URL displayed in the Webview panel.
    * The URL should look similar, but not identical, to: `https://sd-12-1-assessmentserver-individual.<team>.repl.co`.

3. Open the `SD-12-1: Assessment-Individual` Project and complete the tasks.

**Note: Before running any Tests on SD-12-1: Assessment-Individual, be sure to Stop the server, then Run it again to reset your JSON database.**
